## Assignment-01 Description:

Consider real-world information networks of different scale (at least 3 different standard
datasets).
Design an information network analysis strategy for measuring the various network
properties listed below.
1. Average degree
2. Degree distribution
3. Sparseness
4. Diameter
5. Geodesic path length
6. Strongly connected components (SCC)
7. SCC properties
8. 1-connectedness to k-connectedness; what is k for your graph?
9. Clustering coefficient & average clustering coefficient 

## Assignment-02 Description:

Consider the real-world information networks of different scales that you used for the
Assignment-1, Apply the formal models listed below on your datasets and verify the inherent
properties exhibited by the graph data chosen by you.
1. Erdos-Renyi Model
2. Watts-Strogatz Model
3. Barabasi-Albert Model

## Assignment-03 Description:

1. Calculate and compare PageRank of the top 100 pages, and generate a ranked list based on the calculated scores.
2. Which of the Web Pages have the highest and lowest PageRank? What are your observations regarding the scale-free nature of real-world graphs and its impact on PageRank?
3. Correlate your calculated scores with reference to the experiments performed in Assignment 1 (w.r.t various network properties) and write a detailed analysis of your observations, along with plots of the rank/score distribution.
